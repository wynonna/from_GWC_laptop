    <h3>What I've learnt so far in Girls Who Code</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Today, Friday, June 30th, 2017, is my second day in Girls Who Code. I got a late start, but I believe I have learnt alot in HTML. Hopefully this website proves this. Instead of sticking of the regular GWC curriculum, one of the teacher assistance taught us manual. I really enjoy this type of language, and I will be looking further in expanding my skills.</li>
