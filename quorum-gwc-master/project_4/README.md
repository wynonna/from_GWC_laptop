# Trendline Project
In this project you are going to generate a trendline graph of the number of bills sponsored that mention a topic over time.

##Overall Process
1. Use our bill API to figure out which how many bills mentions a particular topic over time.
2. Next, we'll convert the format given by the API (a list of dictionaries) into a csv.
3. Visualize that CSV through a trendline visualization you'll run on your local server on your computer.


## How to Run Your Localserver
1. Run `python3 -m http.server`
2. Go to `localhost:8000` in your local browser
3. Rejoice!
