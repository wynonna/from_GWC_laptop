# Choropleth Project
In this project you are going to generate a map with each state colored by the number of sponsors and cosponsors on bills related to some particular word or phrase!

## Overall Process
1. Use our bill API to find the number of sponsors and cosponsors on bills that mention a particular word or phrase.
2. Combine your results into a CSV.
3. Visualize that CSV through a choropleth visualization you'll run on your local server on your computer.

## How to Run Your Localserver
1. For Python 2.x, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. For Python3, run `python3 -m http.server`
2. Go to `localhost:8000` in your local browser
3. Rejoice!
