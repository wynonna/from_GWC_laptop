# Wordcloud Project
For this project, we're going to take a word or phrase and a set of documents and find out which words are used most frequently at the same time when mentioned by Members.

##Overall Process
1. First we're going to do this the easy way: we're going to use the wordcloud function built into the Quorum API to return results. To do this, we're going to subclass the QuorumAPI class to make one that supports making wordclouds.
2. Next, we'll convert the format given by the API (a list of dictionaries) to the format needed by our visualization tool (a list of lists)
3. Finally, we'll visualize this using a pre-built wordcloud visualization.


*Extra Credit*: Roll your own WordCloud function to transform a list of documents into the counts of the most common words.
